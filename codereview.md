# Code review and pull request

The main purpose of our code reviews is to do findings which can't be caught by automated tools.

Stuff we are looking for in out code review is:

- Is the code covered with unit tests? "This requires a unit test"
- Is the code clear and readable? Naming, semantics and length, both the reviewer and developer should be able to read the code
- Is the code implementing known anti-patterns? 
- Are APIs used as originally intended?

The code review should not the the main source of knowledge sharing, for this is pair programming a much better exercise.

Constructive criticism is encouraged in the pull requests. As a rule of tumb should you provide a reason to your criticism and in best of all worlds even a suggestion to a better solution. And if you don't, you should be prepared to be ignored.
