# Mindmapping

The goal of an mindmapping session is to collect as many associations to a word as possible, and associations to these words.

## How do we do this

Each team gets a piece of paper with one word (or short sentence)  on it.

Each team member gets a pen in different colors (not black).

Within a given timeframe gets each team member to opportunity to add one association to the mindmap. After the time is up is the mindmap parse to the next group. This group is then giving points to the previous mindmap.

Group 1: Start on mindmap

Group 2: Give points to the associations made by group 1

Group 3: Continues on the mind map

Group 4: Give points to the new associations made by group 3

## Points

The following points can be given:

1 point: Given for an association

2 points: Given for an association another teammembers association.

3 points: To be used only for association words which is especially important for the subject. (most likely as most of these given to the first group).
